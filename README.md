# testshade
form works but no the vbo projekt ;/ some minor shit there shader i think

the testshade project (vbo) needs fixing, it just render blank blue screen, something with shader. and form one has disorted uv or normal
 u need opentk and assimp net.
  gls shader goes into form debug and vert.vert-frag.frag goes into vbo debug
